        Print an array of strings 
        Access a single value in an array 
    2. Array Challange 2

## Wednesday 

    maps 
        Write a map with string key and int value and then print it out. 
            syntaxt: (map[key-type]val-type)
            Tip: Use go built in funcation 'make' to create a map 
            map is used for creating hash map data structure and you need to learn more about it 
            
## Thursday

    for loops
        Print hello_world 5 times 
            Outpput: 
                Inner loop 0
                Inner loop 1
                Inner loop 2
                Inner loop 3
                Inner loop 4
                Inner loop 5
    nested for loop
        Create a nested loop that prints out outer loop and inner loop values in same line 
        Outer loop i := 10
        Inner loop j := 3

    break statement 
        Create a for loop that iterates 10 times. Add a break statement inside the for loop to break out of the loop when it iterates 4 times 
        Output: 
            Inner loop 0
            Inner loop 1
            Inner loop 2
            Inner loop 3
            Inner loop 4
            Inner loop 5
            Breaking out of the loop as I is eq to 5
    continue statement

## Saturday 

    file handling 
        Read text file.txt 
        Inclide error handling 
        
## Sunday

    struct 
            - Note: Think about the stuct syntax before you dive int it. 
            - Create a person struct and print fname, lname, and age 
            - Create an app that prints out specs of MacBook. The struct should be in a module
            - Create an app called bobs-computer
                    - App should list out products 
                                Macbook 
                                Windows 
                    - Module name: Computer 
                    - struct name Spec
                    - Items in struct 
                                Product1
                                Product2
